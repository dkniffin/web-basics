    <h1>HTML attributes</h1>
    <p>Each HTML tag has a few parts to it, such as the opening tag, the closing tag and attributes.</p>

    <p>
      This exercise focuses on the HTML attributes. A list of some of the most common attributes
      can be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes">here</a>.
      The beginning of this document will go through a few of the most commonly used global
      attributes that can be used on any HTML element. After that, there will be some examples of
      specific attributes, especially focused on forms and input elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Common HTML Attributes</h2>

    <h3>id</h3>

    <p>
      The first important attribute is <code>id</code>, which is used to define a unique identifier
      within the whole document. It's purpose is to identify the element when linking, styling,
      or scripting:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        For linking, you can create a URL that links directly to any element on a page by adding a
        "#identifier-name" to the end. For example, clicking on a link with an href of
        <code>https://example.com#foo-bar</code> will navigate the user to https://example.com,
        with the page scrolled down to focus on an element with <code>id="foo-bar"</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For styling, in CSS you can target an individual element on the page using the
        <code>id</code>. For example, the CSS <code>#id { color: red; }</code> would make the text
        color red for the element with <code>id="foo-bar"</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For scripting, in Javascript you can get a reference to an element using the
        <code>id</code>. For example, to get a reference to the element with
        <code>id="foo-bar"</code>, you can use the JS code
        <code>document.getElementById("foo-bar")</code> or
        <code>document.querySelector("#foo-bar")</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>class</h3>

    <p>
      The next important attribute is <code>class</code>. This attribute defines a space-separated
      list of classes for an element. For example, if an element has <code>class="foo bar"</code>,
      then that element has the class "foo" and the class "bar". These classes are primarily used
      for CSS styling, though they can be used for scripting as well. In the above example,
      that element would have all of the CSS styles for both <code>.foo</code> and <code>.bar</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>data-* attributes</h3>

    <p>
      The final set of common HTML attributes that we'll cover here are ones that start with
      the <code>data-</code> prefix. These attributes are the way for developers to define their
      own data about an element, and they are typically used to pass data to Javascript. We'll
      cover the in more depth when we learn JS.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Side-note:</strong> the * in the title for this section is called a wild-card.
      You'll see it occasionally in the context of programming. It basically means "anything
      could go here". For example, this section is referring to <code>data-foo</code>,
      <code>data-bar</code>, <code>data-something-else</code>,
      <code>data-whatever-custom-thing-you-can-think-of</code>, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Forms and inputs</h2>

    <p>
      An important part of HTML is the ability to create forms. Let's go over some elements
      found in forms.
    </p>

    <h3>form tag</h3>

    <p>
      The first tag in a form is
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form">the form tag</a>.
      It is used to set up a form that can be submitted to a backend. All other elements in the
      form are nested inside of the form tag.
    </p>

    <form>
      <p>This should be a basic text field:</p>
      <label for="text_field">Text field</label>
      <input type="text" name="text_field" id="text_field" required>

      <p>This should be a checkbox that is checked by default:</p>
      <label for="checkbox_field">Checkbox field</label>
      <input type="checkbox" name="checkbox_field" id="checkbox_field" checked>

      <p>This date box should default to 2021-06-02, and only allow dates between 2010-01-01 and 2030-01-01:</p>
      <label for="date_field">Date field</label>
      <input type="date" name="date_field" id="date_field" value="2021-06-02" min="2010-01-01" max="2030-01-01">

      <p>This file picker should only allow png and jpeg files:</p>
      <label for="file_field">File field</label>
      <input type="file" name="file_field" id="file_field" accept="image/png, image/jpeg">

      <p>The third radio here should be checked by default and they should all be connected so you can only pick one of them:</p>
      <label for="radio_field_1">Option 1</label>
      <input type="radio" name="radio_field" id="radio_field_1" value="option-1">
      <label for="radio_field_2">Option 2</label>
      <input type="radio" name="radio_field" id="radio_field_2" value="option-2">
      <label for="radio_field_3">Option 3</label>
      <input type="radio" name="radio_field" id="radio_field_3" value="option-3" checked>
      <label for="radio_field_4">Option 4</label>
      <input type="radio" name="radio_field" id="radio_field_4" value="option-4">

      <br />

      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
